      <h3 class="privacy-header">Our Response to Notices</h3>
      <p class="privacy-p">
        Upon receiving a valid copyright infringement notice, we will take
        appropriate action, which may include removing or disabling access to
        the allegedly infringing material. We will also notify the user
        responsible for the content in question and may terminate repeat
        infringers' accounts in accordance with our Terms of Use.
      </p>

      <h3 class="privacy-header">Counter-Notification</h3>
      <p class="privacy-p">
        If you believe that your content was removed or disabled by mistake or
        misidentification, you may submit a counter-notification to us. Your
        counter-notification should include the following information:
      </p>
      <ul class="terms-ul">

        </li>
        <li class="privacy-p">
          A statement, made under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith
          belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of
          mistake or misidentification.

        <li class="privacy-p">Your physical or electronic signature.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Upon receiving a valid counter-notification, we may restore the removed
        content unless the original complainant files a court action against you
        within ten business days of receiving the counter-notification.
